# 🎮 Awentale Studio

**3D Narrative RPG • Turn-Based Combat • Standalone Story Worlds**

Awentale Studio is an independent game studio dedicated to creating immersive 3D fictional worlds through story-driven RPG experiences.

We focus on building complete narrative games — not live-service titles — where each release delivers a full, self-contained journey with a clear beginning and ending.

### ⚔️ Strategic Turn-Based Combat

## 💡 Development Philosophy

We believe story RPGs should feel like complete works — similar to novels or films.

Each game is designed to be:

- Fully playable as a standalone experience  
- Focused on narrative depth over endless grinding  
- Memorable from beginning to conclusion  

Players purchase a title, experience its full story, and carry its impact forward into future releases within the same universe.

## 🚀 Vision

To build a long-lasting original RPG universe through high-quality standalone titles that prioritize storytelling, immersion, and meaningful gameplay.

## 🧠 Studio Mindset

> “Great worlds are remembered not because they last forever —  
> but because their stories are worth finishing.”
